# hello-world
First GITHUB repository

I am interested in teaching myself python for a few reasons. One is just because I enjoy learning and have an interest in Blender animation software, as well as using it to animate spreadsheets, update database and extract date from database for analytical models. Two it will be another item off my bucket list.
