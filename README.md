s# hello-world
First GITHUB repository

I am interested in teaching myself python for a few reasons. One, is I enjoy learning new things and have an interest in Blender animation software, as well as using it to animate spreadsheets, update databases and to extract data from databases for analytical models. Two, it will be another item off my bucket list.
